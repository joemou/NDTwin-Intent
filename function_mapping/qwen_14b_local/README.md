## Introduction

Qwen2.5-Coder is the latest series of Code-Specific Qwen large language models (formerly known as CodeQwen). As of now, Qwen2.5-Coder has covered six mainstream model sizes, 0.5, 1.5, 3, 7, 14, 32 billion parameters, to meet the needs of different developers. Qwen2.5-Coder brings the following improvements upon CodeQwen1.5:

- Significantly improvements in **code generation**, **code reasoning** and **code fixing**. Base on the strong Qwen2.5, we scale up the training tokens into 5.5 trillion including source code, text-code grounding, Synthetic data, etc. Qwen2.5-Coder-32B has become the current state-of-the-art open-source codeLLM, with its coding abilities matching those of GPT-4o.
- A more comprehensive foundation for real-world applications such as **Code Agents**. Not only enhancing coding capabilities but also maintaining its strengths in mathematics and general competencies.

**This repo contains the 0.5B Qwen2.5-Coder model**, which has the following features:
- Type: Causal Language Models
- Training Stage: Pretraining
- Architecture: transformers with RoPE, SwiGLU, RMSNorm, Attention QKV bias and tied word embeddings
- Number of Parameters: 0.49B
- Number of Paramaters (Non-Embedding): 0.36B
- Number of Layers: 24
- Number of Attention Heads (GQA): 14 for Q and 2 for KV
- Context Length: Full 32,768 tokens
  
**We do not recommend using base language models for conversations.** Instead, you can apply post-training, e.g., SFT, RLHF, continued pretraining, etc., or fill in the middle tasks on this model.

For more details, please refer to our [blog](https://qwenlm.github.io/blog/qwen2.5-coder-family/), [GitHub](https://github.com/QwenLM/Qwen2.5-Coder), [Documentation](https://qwen.readthedocs.io/en/latest/), [Arxiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.12186).

## Requirements

The code of Qwen2.5-Coder has been in the latest Hugging face `transformers` and we advise you to use the latest version of `transformers`.

With `transformers<4.37.0`, you will encounter the following error:
```
KeyError: 'qwen2'
```


## Evaluation & Performance

Detailed evaluation results are reported in this [📑 blog](https://qwenlm.github.io/blog/qwen2.5-coder-family/).

For requirements on GPU memory and the respective throughput, see results [here](https://qwen.readthedocs.io/en/latest/benchmark/speed_benchmark.html).
